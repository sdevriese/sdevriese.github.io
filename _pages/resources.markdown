There are loads of great resources to learn nowadays. Here's a list of sites that I've found useful.

# Python
* [Learn Python The Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex0.html)
If you already have programming experience this is a great way to see how things are done in Python.

# C/C++


# JavaScript
* [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
This book has a great introduction to not only JavaScript but numerous computer science topics.

# Matlab


# Physics
