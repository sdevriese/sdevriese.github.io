Hi, my name is Sarah Devriese. This site is currently under construction as I'm figuring out markdown while also keeping things tidy with Git. Stay tuned!

I finished my PhD in geophysics in 2016 and am currently a postdoctoral research fellow with the Geophysical Inversion Facility at the University of British Columbia. My interestes include applied geophysics, inversion, survey design, and data analysis. In broader terms, I'm interested in environmental applications, data science, numerical analysis, and of course mountain biking.

I love to ride my bike and ever since university, I've loved to snowboard and ski. I like to sew things and experiment with baking. And I like to write: stories about biking and skiing and geophysics-related papers.

Since spring 2017, my husband and I have an australian shepherd: a stray from Texas that has the biggest personality imaginable. I had to no idea a dog could have such expressions and emotions. I'm trying to understand his language and he's probably thinking the same. He makes my heart leap.
