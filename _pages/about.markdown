Hi, my name is Johnny ~~Minor~~ Devriese. I graduated in spring 2017 with a B.S. in Physics from Washington State University.
I'm always interested in deepening my understanding of computer science, solving physics problems using code,
and I'm also an avid landscape photographer.

Nowadays, you'll probably find me hacking on whichever project has my current interest, going on adventures with my lovely wife, or riding my bike.

My Wife and I opted for the path less traveled when we chose to move to Boise, ID. People are always curious why we could
choose Boise over the PNW big brothers like Seattle or Portland.
After a wonderful internship at Buildpulse Inc. in 2016 we just decided we weren't a great fit for the hustle and bustle of the big metropolis areas.
Once I graduated we moved to Boise and haven't looked back since.
