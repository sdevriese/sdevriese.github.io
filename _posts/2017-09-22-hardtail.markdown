In 2015, I wrote a number of blog posts and interviews for [Ozmosis Training][ozweb]. I hope to add links to these articles here to better archive them and keep a record of what I've written.

The first one and probably most popular one was on the benefits of riding a hardtail (versus a full-suspension bike). Two years later, I still ride my hardtail, especially during the winter, as it is more challenging, requires less cleaning at the end of a ride, and makes me work harder. Since this article, I started riding a drop-bar gravel bike as well and now I'm thinking... I should write a post about how that has benefitted my mountain biking fitness and skills!

Find the article "The benefits of the hardtail: why and when" [here][ozhardtail].

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
