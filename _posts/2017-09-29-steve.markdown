Part of the blog posts I wrote for [Ozmosis Training][ozweb] in 2015 were interviews with people who were in the biking scene in some way or another. Some were part of non-profit organizations, others were in the bike industry. The first interview was with Steve Sheldon about 2.5 years ago. I've gotten to know Steve better since and we are both TORCA directors now. His dog Barley and my dog Raider get along really well too. 

Find the interview "Meet Steve the TORCA builder" [here][ozsteve].

<!--
You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
